## Notes

- Be mindful of function purity while TDDing
- Upgrades/improvements:
    - Rethink directory structure/file placement
    - Check relative linking conventions for consistency
    - Modularize CSS
    - Reorganize JS modules
        - _important: move and rename "app.js" (not common, only applies to products page)_
        - Standardize naming conventions for JS files
            - Datasets vs exported functions
    - figure out how to make cart-confirmation animation work without creating so many extraneous new elements
